## Tips for Selection:
- Look for moody, cinematic lighting
- Avoid overly happy/commercial feeling shots
- Consider black & white or desaturated colors
- Look for "film photography" or "analog" tagged photos for that VHS aesthetic
- Search for "editorial portrait" for more artistic/emotional shots

## Color Grading Suggestion:
Once you have the photos, apply a consistent filter:
- Reduce saturation slightly
- Add a blue/purple tint to shadows
- Slight grain/noise for VHS feel
- Vignetting for that analog look
